  abstract="This paper investigates the security of Proactive Secret Sharing
    Schemes. We start with revision of the mobile adversary model of Herzberg's
    et al. imposing less restriction to the adversary. We first investigate the
    approach of using commitment to 0 in the renewal phase in order to renew
    the player's shares. In the considered model some well known
    computationally secure protocols (which use this approach) turns out to be
    vulnerable to a specific attack. We show that this type of attack is
    applicable also in the unconditional case. Then we extend the attack of
    D'Arco and Stinson to non-symmetric polynomials, which is applicable even
    in the mobile adversary model of Herzberg et al. Next the conditions for
    the security of a proactive scheme using this approach are shown. We also
    investigate another approach to add proactivity, namely using re-sharing
    instead of commitment to 0. Two protocols using this approach are described
    and it is shown that both are not secure against a mobile adversary. The
    main contribution of the paper is to show specific weaknesses, when a
    mobile adversary is considered.",
